    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Though plain, these oatmeal cookies are a good base for a custom recipe — try adding raisins, 
        dried berries, nuts, or chocolate chips. Quick-cooking oats give the cookies a softer texture,
        and can be swapped with old-fashioned oats for a chewier result.</p>
    <h1>Ingredients</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 cup softened unsalted butter</li>
        <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
        <li>1 cup brown sugar</li>
        <li>3 cups quick-cooking oats</li>
        <li>1 1/2 tsp ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>1 tsp baking soda</li>
        <li>1 tsp salt</li>
        <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Steps</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix flour, cinnamon, baking soda, and salt together in a bowl.</li>
        <li>Beat butter and sugar in a separate bowl until creamy.</li>
        <li>Add eggs and vanilla in the butter mixture. Beat the eggs in one at a time.</li>
        <li>Slowly add in the dry mixture until well combined. Add the oats.</li>
        <li>Cover the dough and let it rest in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375°F <em>(190°C)</em>. 
            In two small bowls, prepare plain water and a little bit of sugar.</li>
        <li>Roll the chilled dough into small balls and place them on baking sheets (greased or sprayed).
            Dip a fork into water and then in sugar, and use it to flatten the cookies.</li>
        <li>Bake for 8—10 minutes or until the centers are nearly set.</li>
        <li>Let the cookies cool before eating.</li>
    </ol>
